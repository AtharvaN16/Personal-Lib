# Scan by Location — Design

## Problem

Cataloguing many books from the same physical shelf currently requires selecting Room + Shelf individually for every scanned book, inside the `BookModal` that `ScanBookModal` swaps into after each lookup. This is the dominant real-world workflow (someone stands at one shelf and scans a stack of books) and today it costs one full location-selection interaction per book.

## Goal

Add an optional **Scan by Location** mode to the existing `ScanBookModal`: pick a default Room/Shelf once, then scan repeatedly with each book auto-assigned that location and appended to an in-modal queue, with cheap per-book overrides and a batch save. The existing single-scan flow (scan → `BookModal` → assign location → save) is unchanged and remains the default when this mode isn't enabled.

## Non-goals

- No changes to `BookModal`'s or `BulkMoveModal`'s existing behavior or markup.
- No persistence of the scanning session (default location, queue) beyond the mounted lifetime of the modal — closing/cancelling clears everything.
- No redesign of visual language: colors, radii (`0px` throughout, per existing modals), typography, shadows, and animation curves are all reused as-is.

## Approach

Extend `ScanBookModal` in place with a `mode: 'single' | 'location'` state, defaulting to `'single'`. The Room/Shelf `<select>` pair is duplicated locally within `ScanBookModal` rather than extracted into a shared component — this matches the codebase's existing convention (`BookModal` and `BulkMoveModal` already each carry their own independent copy of this exact form) and keeps the change fully additive: zero lines touched in `BookModal.tsx` or `BulkMoveModal.tsx`.

Rejected alternative: extract a shared `<LocationPicker>` component used by all three modals. More DRY, but touches two working, unrelated modals to support an optional new feature, for no functional gain — contradicts the "don't redesign, stay additive" constraint on this feature.

## Entry point

On the existing idle "Scan the book" screen, add a small text link below the manual-ISBN input: **"Scan by Location →"**. Clicking it swaps the idle prompt (not the whole modal) for a compact setup view:

- The same Room/Shelf `<select>` pair styled like `BulkMoveModal`'s form (room select → progressively-disclosed shelf select)
- "Start Scanning" (primary button, `--accent-primary` style, matches `styles.retryBtn`/`formSaveBtn` conventions), enabled once a Room is chosen (Shelf optional)
- "Cancel" (text link) returns to the normal idle screen, `mode` stays `'single'`

Choosing "Start Scanning" sets `mode = 'location'`, stores `defaultLocationId`/`defaultLocationObj`, and transitions into the active queue view.

## Active queue view

Single flex-column modal, top to bottom:

1. **Header** — CLOSE button, unchanged.
2. **Default location strip** — "Scanning into: *Living Room • Shelf 1*" (muted secondary text, same tokens as `BookModal`'s `locationText`) with a small "Change" link. Clicking it swaps the strip for the same Room/Shelf selects used in setup, scoped to updating just `defaultLocationId`/`defaultLocationObj`. This does **not** retroactively touch already-queued rows (see State model below).
3. **Scanner controls** — the existing scan icon + "Scan the book" prompt + manual-ISBN field/form, always mounted and listening while in the queue view (`useHardwareScanner` active condition extended to include this state).
4. **Scanned queue list** — see Queue row below. Scrollable once the modal reaches max height.
5. **Save All** — primary button, fixed at the bottom, disabled when the queue is empty or while a save is in flight.

### Height behavior

Today, `ScanBookModal`'s non-`'loaded'` states apply the `book-modal-panel` CSS class, which hard-pins `height: 480px` (so the swap into the real `BookModal` on lookup success doesn't visually jump). The active queue view must **not** use that class. Instead:

- Outer panel: `maxHeight: min(720px, 85svh)`, `overflow: hidden`, `display: flex; flexDirection: column` (mirrors `ManageLocationsModal`'s `.modal` pattern).
- Header, default-location strip, scanner controls, and the Save All button: `flexShrink: 0`.
- Queue list container: `flex: 1; minHeight: 0; overflowY: auto`.

This makes the panel grow naturally with queue content (no fixed height, no explicit resize logic) until it hits the cap, at which point only the queue list scrolls — everything else stays put. This is the same structural pattern already used by `ManageLocationsModal`'s room list.

## Per-scan flow (mode === 'location')

`runLookup` branches on `mode`:

- **`'single'`** — unchanged: sets `draftBook`, transitions `state` to `'loaded'`, renders `BookModal`.
- **`'location'`** — on successful lookup:
  1. Duplicate check against `books` prop **and** the current `queue` (same ISBN-or-title+author logic as today's `handleSaveNew`). On a hit: `showToast('"Title" already exists in library')`, discard the result, stay on the queue view. No queue entry added.
  2. Otherwise, append a new row to `queue`: `{ id: crypto.randomUUID(), title, authors, isbn, cover_url, publisher, published_date, description, locationId: defaultLocationId, location: defaultLocationObj, overridden: false, rowState: 'idle' }`.
  - On lookup failure (`fetchBookByIsbn` returns null/throws): `showToast('Couldn't find that book — ISBN "…"')`. Stay on the queue view, ready for the next scan — no full-screen error state (that screen remains exclusive to `'single'` mode).

During the lookup itself, the scan icon/prompt area shows a small inline "Looking up…" swap (icon dims / spinner replaces the `qr_code_scanner` glyph) rather than the full skeleton layout used in `'single'` mode — avoids layout jank between consecutive scans since there's no cover-preview step in this mode.

`useHardwareScanner`'s `active` condition becomes `(mode === 'single' && state === 'idle') || (mode === 'location' && queueViewReady)`, where `queueViewReady` is true whenever the queue view is mounted and not mid-lookup.

## Queue row

Each row: thumbnail (~40×56, reusing `BookModal`'s `getPlaceholderColor`/`getSpineColor` fallback for missing `cover_url`), title, author below the title, then `Room • Shelf` (or just `Room` if no shelf) as muted secondary text, then three actions: **Save**, **Change**, **Remove**. Styling follows the existing list-row conventions from `ManageLocationsModal` (`displayRow`, `iconBtn`, gap/padding scale) rather than inventing new patterns.

- **Change** — swaps the row's location text for the same compact Room/Shelf selects (mirrors the default-location "Change" interaction), scoped to that row only. Saving it sets `overridden: true` on the row and updates its `locationId`/`location`. Cancelling reverts to the row's prior location text.
- **Save** — inserts that single row via the same Supabase insert path as today's `handleSaveNew` (using the row's current `locationId`). Row's `rowState` becomes `'saving'` (Save button disabled, shows "Saving…"); on success the row is removed from `queue` and `onBookAdded` is called so it lands in the dashboard grid immediately; on failure, `rowState` reverts to `'idle'` and a toast reports the failure, row stays queued.
- **Remove** — filters the row out of `queue` immediately, no confirmation. (Unlike `BookModal`'s delete-confirm, this is an unsaved draft row — low stakes, and the "fast, lightweight" goal argues against an extra confirmation click here.)

## State model

```
mode: 'single' | 'location'
locationSetupOpen: boolean          // true while choosing the initial default, before "Start Scanning"
defaultLocationId: string
defaultLocationObj: { room: string; bookshelf: string } | null
editingDefault: boolean             // default-strip "Change" is open
queue: QueuedBook[]
  QueuedBook = {
    id: string
    title, authors, isbn, cover_url, publisher, published_date, description
    locationId: string
    location: { room: string; bookshelf: string } | null
    overridden: boolean
    rowState: 'idle' | 'saving'
    editingLocation: boolean        // this row's "Change" is open
  }
```

Changing `defaultLocationId`/`defaultLocationObj` via the strip's "Change" only affects **future** appends to `queue` — existing rows keep whatever location they were assigned at scan time, regardless of `overridden`. This avoids retroactively moving books the user already glanced at and accepted.

Unmounting `ScanBookModal` (close/cancel) discards all of the above — no persistence layer, no localStorage, nothing written until a row is explicitly saved.

## Error handling

- Lookup failure → toast, stay on queue view (no full error screen in this mode).
- Duplicate on scan → toast, discard, stay on queue view.
- **Row/Save-All persistence failure → optimistic local fallback, not a retry state.** As implemented, `persistQueuedBook` mirrors the existing single-scan `handleSaveNew`'s behavior exactly: on any Supabase failure (no session, insert error, etc.) it falls back to a local-only mock id, still calls `onBookAdded`, and the row is removed from the queue with the normal "Added to your library" toast — there is no distinct failure toast and no retryable state. This supersedes the original design (row stays queued, retryable, distinct failure toast) recorded above during brainstorming. The original design was written before implementation surfaced that the rest of this app has no concept of a "failed save" the user can retry — saves are optimistic everywhere else too, and diverging just for this feature would be inconsistent and add complexity for a failure mode (Supabase unreachable mid-session) that today only ever produces a local-only book, not a lost one. Confirmed with the user post-implementation (final whole-branch review, 2026-07-10): keep the optimistic-fallback behavior as-is rather than adding fail-stays-queued semantics.

## Testing / verification

No automated test suite exists for these modals today (verified by grep — no `*.test.tsx` under `src/components`), consistent with the rest of the codebase. Verification is manual via `bun dev`:

1. Open Scan modal → "Scan by Location" → pick Room/Shelf → Start Scanning.
2. Scan/manually enter several ISBNs; confirm each lands in the queue with the default location and no interrupting popup.
3. Trigger a duplicate (re-scan an ISBN already in the library or already queued) → confirm toast + no queue entry.
4. Trigger a failed lookup (bogus ISBN) → confirm toast + queue view stays scan-ready.
5. Use "Change" on one row, confirm only that row's location updates and it's marked overridden.
6. Change the default Room/Shelf via the strip after some rows are queued → confirm existing rows are unaffected, only new scans use the new default.
7. Scan enough books to exceed the max height → confirm only the queue list scrolls, header/default-strip/scanner/Save All stay fixed.
8. Save one row individually → confirm it disappears from the queue and appears in the dashboard grid with correct location.
9. Save All → confirm all remaining rows save, queue empties, modal stays open and ready for more scans.
10. Close the modal, reopen, choose Scan by Location again → confirm no leftover queue/default from the prior session.
11. Confirm the existing single-scan flow (no "Scan by Location") is completely unaffected.
